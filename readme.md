# Dr. What? 

> A webpage for translating your medical letters to an understandable language

## Where is the software hosted? 

The software is currently hosted on [drwhat.de](https://drwhat.de). 

## How can I participate? 

Technically, the current version is stable - so we don't need support there. When you are proficient with German medical terms, we would highly appreciate your support. Go to [/mitmachen](https://drwhat.de/mitmachen) and contact us. 

## What about other languages? 

So far, we only offer translations in German. If you would like to help us support other languages, we would highly appreciate your help. Contact us with the form provided on the website.
